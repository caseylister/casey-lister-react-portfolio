Check out my [portfolio](https://caseylister.github.io/react-portfolio/) made using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React! On my portfolio, you will find a section with a little bit about me, past projects, and my resume and proficiencies. You will also find a contact form that can one day be used to contact me; however, as of right now, it is not connected to the back end! Lol. I'm open to any suggestions and tips on making my portfolio stand out!
